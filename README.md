Pelicn Articles List
====================

Pelican static web generator plugin that generates a file/files containing articles list with different parameters. 

This will allow the ability to set up ajax requests and together with that the ability to support endless scrolling 


## Configuration

In order to override the default configuration a variable called ```ARTICLES_LIST``` has to be created inside ```pelicanconf.py```

The available settings are: 

- **output_path** - Ability to use another root instead of the default one (default: the output directory, OUTPUT_PATH)
- **base** - Base path of where the files will be created (default: */articles_list/*)
- **filename** - Base name for the files that will be created (default: *articles_list*)
- **count** - count of articles per file (default: *length of all articles togehter*) 
  
Example:


```
  pelicanconf.py
  
  ARTICLES_LIST = { 'count':2, filename:'some_other_name' }
  
```
